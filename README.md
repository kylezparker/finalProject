This is a social media website.



This project still needs work in may areas. accounts/urls, accounts/models, accounts/views all need work. world/urls, world/models, world/views. 

The above needs to be taken care of for CRUD. After that the social media part of the site must be implemented.

Update

CRUD working. run project by typing "python3 manage.py runserver" in terminal, then copy http link to display in browser.

htmls have been set up for "world" and "friends", can now design and implement social media features as well as user interface.

email service has not been set up so password reset and change do not function; should be fixed soon.

project has not been deployed or set up on heroku/other service, currently using django test server.
